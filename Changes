Revision history for Config-MVP-Writer-INI

{{$NEXT}}

  - Don't leave a trailing space on a line where a config value is blank
  - Try harder to match the name to the package moniker to avoid duplicates.
  - Add 'strip_bundle_prefix' option to always remove the "@Foo/" part of
    the section name (default true).  This cuts down on the noise when the
    name is actually different from the package moniker.
